You have been given an proof-of-concept Android project developed by a junior Android developer that displays a list of deals in Target stores. The goal of the app is to display a list of deals currently offered by Target, and to provide information on those deals. As a POC, the app just has a few deals hardcoded in and the code is pretty rough. It is your job to turn this app into something useful!

1. Fix up the deals list to (as best as you can) match the mockups shown in DealsList.png.
2. Instead of displaying an alert when a deal is selected, instead present a new view that displays details on the view. Use the mockups shown in DealsDetails.png.
3. The deals are currently hardcoded. Use the API at https://target-deals.herokuapp.com to grab the real deals to display in the app.
4. Do something interesting! Add something to the app you think can really make it fun to use. 

Some guidelines:
- Preferred language is Kotlin but feel free to use any open source software you feel helps development. Treat this app as something you control technically.
- Do your best to follow modern Android conventions and write clean, performant, and extensible code. Imagine that this app will continue to grow.
- Be sure the app looks great on a variety of phone screen sizes!

Suggestions for optional exploration:
- This app was targeted at API level 19. What exciting options become available by updating it to target API level 24?
- This app is focused at phones primarily, but is a prime candidate for a flexible design that would intelligently expand for tablets.
- The initial screen is a list view. How would you implement a toggle for grid view and what would that grid view look like?
- Ignore these suggestions and find your own inspiration.
